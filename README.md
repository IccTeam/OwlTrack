 • Owltrack tool is a tool used for investigation, scanner, and also in attacks. Here I will explain each use of the menus available in owltrack.
 1. Phone Number Information
    This menu functions to identify a number and find out specific information from the target number, The results produced vary. For example, when scanning is taking place, we will get the results in the form of target number information, namely: ``` Telecommunication Network, Line Type, Country, Location, Even we can get Lat & Long of target number.``` and there are many more that can be produced from this menu, and you can try it yourself.
  2. Lookup Number
     Lookup Number has the same function as the first menu, namely phone number information. However, ```with this number lookup we can get the name of the number owner, location, etc.```
  3. Ip Address Information
     In this menu, there are 3 different IP tracking methods and of course the information provided is also varied. for sure this menu is very suitable for tracking ip addresses and it works 100%
  4. Email Address Information
     As the name suggests, this menu functions to validate and verify email addresses. In this menu, Owltrack has 3 menus, including the email scan method, I will mention 3 menus in the email address information menu:
     ```
     • Email Address Information
     • Email Finder With domain, first name, last name
     • Email Validation
     ```
     Here I will not explain in more detail, you can try it yourself on owltrack.
   5. DDoS Menu
      On owltrack there is a DDoS () menu which is definitely aimed at attacking a website by sending bots until the web server goes down. In this menu, DDoS WiFi is also available, with the aim of making WiFi slow or even unusable. In DDoS this menu has 3 options in it, namely:
      ```
      • DoS Website
      • DDoS Website
      • DDoS Wifi
      ```
    I don't need to explain further about the results and so on, you can try it yourself and see for yourself how. And I will emphasize, if you do any criminal activity using this menu, I ```[owlbird05/Abid .Z]``` will not be responsible for what you do.
   6. Website Content Crwaler
      This menu is used for crawling content on a website, so what it means is, when we enter a target from a website, it will give us results like the content on the website. So the method is like a web scraper to find information about a website. I will provide photos of the results, what you get from this menu:
